A security assessment was conducted to evaluate the overall safety of the systems and applications. The review identified several weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers if left unaddressed. These issues include outdated system components, insecure application configurations, and improper handling of sensitive information.

The findings indicate a higher-than-acceptable security risk level, meaning that confidential data and system availability could be impacted during a real cyberattack. While no actual damage was performed during this assessment, the vulnerabilities discovered demonstrate potential entry points for unauthorized access.

To reduce these risks, it is strongly recommended to apply system updates, improve security configurations, and follow secure development practices. Regular security testing and monitoring should also be implemented. Taking these steps will significantly improve the organization’s security posture and reduce the likelihood of future incidents.
